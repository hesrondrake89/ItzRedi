# Inspiration
I was inspired to create ItzRedi App because I love food and I love technology. I wanted to create an app that would make it easy for people to order food from their favorite restaurants, and I also wanted to learn more about how to build mobile apps.

# Technical Challenge
The biggest technical challenge I faced when building ItzRedi App was integrating with the API of a third-party food delivery service. I had to learn how to use the API to get the data I needed, and I also had to learn how to handle errors that might occur when communicating with the API.

# Struggles
I struggled with a few things when building ItzRedi App. First, I had to learn a lot of new things about mobile app development. I had never built a mobile app before, so I had to learn about things like user interface design, app architecture, and mobile app testing. Second, I had to learn how to use the API of a third-party food delivery service. This was a bit challenging, but I was able to find some helpful resources online.

# Next Iteration
I'm still working on improving ItzRedi App. In the next iteration, I plan to add the following features:

The ability to save favorite restaurants
The ability to track order status
The ability to rate and review restaurants
